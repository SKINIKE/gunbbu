# Unity Package Manager
# Packages that are referenced by manifest.json and packages-lock.json should not be committed.
# These are regenerated by Unity from these two files.
# However, if you have EMBEDDED or LOCAL packages within the Packages folder,
# you might need to un-ignore them by adding lines like:
# !Packages/com.my-company.my-local-package/
# !Packages/my-embedded-package/
